When it comes to the Gibbs sampling we have had some difficulties along the way and can not say we got the sampler to work.
First we've had big problems with initializing the system, with starting value of the energy sometimes getting below the expectation value. This is a problem since the energy then only keeps sinking without end, never reaching the true expectation value. \\
Another problem is the calculation of the hidden and visible nodes. We are essentially accepting all new configurations compared to standard Metropolis. Making it a less reliable method than Metropolis.
