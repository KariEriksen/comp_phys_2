In this work we explore a system of many bosons in a harmonic oscillator trap at temperatures low enough for Bose-Einstein condesation. A variational monte-carlo machinery is implemented as a solution to find the expecation value of the energy as a function of a single variational parameter $\alpha$. Over this variational parameter the ground-state energies are found by gradient descent both for a non-interactive case and with a repulsive potential. As an additional improvement to the convergence of the algorithm an importance sampling techinque for chosing the proposed next step in the metropolis algorithm is implemented. Lastly we consider the onebody densities for both systems with and without a repulsive interaction and find most particles to be localized for the non-interactive case and distributed according to a bell curve when we introduce interactions.
