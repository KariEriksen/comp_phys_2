In this work we explore two fermions in a harmonic oscillator trap both with and without a repulsive coloumb interaction. In place of the traditional ansatz for the wavefunction we optimize a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) which is in the family of generative machine learning models. We find that the Metropolis algorith has both better stability and performance over alternative sampling models explored. In additon to the Metropolis algorithm versions with Importance and Gibbs sampling were implemented. For systems in two and three dimensions the importance sampling algorithm was quite unstable under variations of the hyperparameters like learning rate and the initial spread of the sampling space. The Gibbs sampler we were unable to imlpement in a satisfactory manner. Opting to use the Metropolis implementation we also explored adding a simple Coloumb interaction to the hamiltonian. For the $N = D = 2$ case we observe that the model is able to come within one decimal place of the analytical value of $3$ a.u. at approximately $3.1 \pm 0.2$ a.u.
