\section{Conclusion}
In this project we've shown the possible use cases of a generative machine learning algorithm applied to a simple many-body phyisics problem. For two non-interactive fermions we've shown convergence to analytical values when simulatig with a VMC + RBM model with a simple metropolis algorithm. Further  we implemented two different sampling schemes to try and improve the model. From our results it would seem importance sampling is very sensitive to the hyper-parameters of the model while we were unable to produce satisfactory results with the gibbs sampler at all.
