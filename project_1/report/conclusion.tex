\section{Conclusion}
A system of many bosons in a harmonic oscillator trap, at temperatures low enough for Bose-Einstein
condensation, has been explored using variational monte-carlo techniques to find the expectation
value for the energy as a function of a single variational parameter $\alpha$. The system is
explored both with and without a repulsive potatential between particles, and in both cases the
method of gradient descent is used to find ground-state energies. To improve the convergence of
the algorithm, importance sampling was implemented, but left much to be desired as an improvement
was not observed. Lastly, the onebody densities for the system with and without interaction was
concidered, showing most particles were localized for the non-interactive case, and distributed
fitting a bell curve in the interactive case.
