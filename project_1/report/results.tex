\section{Results}
\subsection*{\textbf{1b):} Developing your code and \textbf{1d):} A better statistical analysis}

The results of the simulations are included in the appendix as figures \ref{fig:1b_1} \ref{fig:1b_10}, \ref{fig:1b_100} and \ref{fig:1b_500}. The results were produced with the code in the repository at commit 
\lstinline{b0ff612bc6666335b106af5e22a7a13a13c7cff7}. Errors in the expectation value for the energy in the plots are computed with the blocking method\footnote{the implementation is a copy of the code from LINK TO THE GITHUB WITH MARIUS'S CODE}
